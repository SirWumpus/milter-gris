--TODO--


--0.25--

   *	Requires LibSnert 1.75.56

   !	Fix configure and makefile files with respect to recent
   	changes to LibSnert.

--0.24--

   *	Requires LibSnert 1.75.8+

   !	Configure and build changes to reflect changes in libsnert.

   !	Fix localhost, LAN, and access-db white listing.

--0.23--

   -	Disable rejection deferral for newer versions of libmilter.

--0.22--

   !	filterRcpt: when no cached record exists, the new TEMPFAIL
   	record neglected to initialise the touch time to "now".
   	Reported by Thaddeus Perala.

--0.21.115--

   !	cacheUpdate: now always updates the touch time.

--0.21.114--

   !	Fixed documentation: -C should have been cache-accept-ttl.

--0.21--

  !!	Regression. Cache update code for the initial temporary
	failure went missing. Reported by Rene Berber.

   !	Regression. When block-time-static is disabled, then block-
	time should always be used.

   +	Added start-up check that block-time is never negative.

--0.20.112--

   !	Removed configure script dependence on SQLite3.

--0.20--

   +	Requires LibSnert 1.63

   !	isIpInClientName() replaced by isIPv4InClientName() to fix
	issues with scanning the client's host name from the reverse
	DNS of the client's IP address. Reported by Ren√© Berber. The
	new version is more comprehensive in octet patterns it
	searches for. See libsnert/1.63 net/ipinclient.c.

   !	atExitCleanUp(): added NULL guard around cache cleanup code in
   	case its the cache was not initialised.

   !	cacheUpdate() fixed bug concerning updates to the timestamp
	during the grey-list period that would cause the grey-list
	entry to block almost indefinitely. Reported by Mike Elliott

   !	Default cache-temp-fail-ttl changed from one week to 25 hours.

   !	Corrected documentation error concerning two cache-type
	options when it should have been cache-file and cache-type.

   !	Corrected documentation error concerning completely wrong
   	description of access-db taken from another milter.

   +	access-db now supports socket-map, flat-file, and SQLite3
	lookups in addition to Berkeley DB. The SQLite3 behaviour
	can be disabled via LibSnert's ./configure script.

   !	Rejection based on access-db blacklisting now disabled. Some
	users prefer leaving blacklisting upto Sendmail and not the
	milter. Reported by Derek Balling and others.

--0.19--

   +	Requires LibSnert 1.62

   !	Postfix 2.3 does not support the sendmail {if_addr} macro, so
	use the client_addr field as an alternative to detecting the
	loopback or local machine IP in filterData(). Note this only
	applies if you build sendmail/libmilter with -DSMFI_VERSION=4.

  !!	License 1.4 which provides additional details with regards to
  	possible license controls used, the possibility of "phone
  	home code" and its general contents, and related privacy
  	statement.

   +	Add check for filterOpen() got NULL socket address pointer
	passed to filterOpen() which inidicates an unsupported address
	type. The connection is simply accepted to bypass the milter.

--0.18--

   +	Requires LibSnert 1.61

  !!	Complete replacement of option specification and no backwards.
	compatibility. The newer format allows for better integration
	of previously undocumented libsnert options and for the
	inclusion of future enhancements.

   !	filterClose(): remove reporting of "null workspace error",
	which can occur when a client connection is rejected before or
	by filterOpen().

   !	Minor corrections for gcc -Wall warnings.

   !	Fix possible race condition in updating cache entries. Replaced
	cachePut() with cacheUpdate().

--0.17--

   -	The -r option has been removed. It was disabled in 0.7. This
	option provef to be troublesome and its continued presence
	would just allow those class of users who turn on all the
	knobs without understanding to shoot themselves in the foot.

   !	Reverted back to libmilter's default (7210s) timeout. This
	should silence many of the reported sendmail to milter timeout
	errors and/or broken connections caused by the milter timing
	out sooner than sendmail does with the current SMTP client.
	The sendmail defaults for each SMTP command and receiving the
	message content is 1h each and so libmilter allows for 2h 10s.
	But in theory you could be DoS for between 5 and 104 hours per
	connection. If you want to change this then set in
	sendmail.mc:

		define(`confTO_DATABLOCK',      `30m')
		define(`confTO_COMMAND',        `5m')

--0.16--

   !	filterOpen() should have checked for SMDB_ACCESS_ERROR from
   	smfAccessHost().

--0.15--

   +	Requires LibSnert 1.57

   +	Added support for

   		milter-length-auth:auth_authen		RHS
   		milter-length-auth:			RHS

   +	When using the -n option, MAIL FROM:<postmaster@...> always
   	accepted now like the DSN. However, a message from a postmaster
	address will be blocked at the DATA command if sendmail and
	libmilter extensions have been enabled. This prevents abuse by
	spammers. See milter-sender MxCallBackAsPostmaster.

--0.14--

   +	Requires LibSnert 1.56

   !	Changed install.sh.in to create /var/run/mitler/ directory
   	owned by milter:milter and change the default PID_FILE and
   	SOCKET_FILE paths. This provides better privelage/security
   	separation since the milters run as milter:milter.

--0.13--

   +	Requires LibSnert 1.53

   !	filterRcpt() now proper handles per RCPT white listing such
	that a single white listed recipient does NOT white list the
	whole message for all other RCPTs. Requested by Sergey Stepanov.

--0.12--

   !	Fix bug when sendmail & libmilter are NOT built with
   	-DSMFI_VERSION=4, then use old behaviour otherwise nothing
   	happens.

--0.11--

   !	Touch the timestamp of successful grey-list cache entries that
	continue to remain active so as to avoid grey-listing a second
	time. Requested by Arne Handtmann.

	The original design was to always expire entries, even
	successful ones, in order to retest on occassion. But this
	negatively impacts legit senders more that the value of
	retesting. milter-sender made a similar policy change a while
	back and so precedent has been set.

   !	When sendmail & libmilter are built with -DSMFI_VERSION=4,
	which enables xxfi_unknown and xxfi_data command handlers,
	then the temporary fail is defered until the DATA command is
	sent. This allows for better handling of call-back systems
	like milter-sender. Based on a suggestion from Claus Assmann.

--0.10--

   !	install.sh: fix use of id -u, which doesn't work on SunOS

   !	install.sh: fix use of bang (!) logical-NOT operator, which
   	is not available in real Bourne shells or csh.

   !	install.sh: SunOS grep does not have a -q option

   !	install.sh: fixed "if which command ; then" tests with a
	function. which(1) always returns success (0) on SunOS.

   !	install.sh: SunOS has two different install(1) tools with
   	different options (-o vs. -u) to set the file owner.

   !	The default value for -I would act like -I 0 instead of being
   	disabled.

--0.9--

   +	Requires LibSnert 1.41

   !	Fixed configure.in script to better handle Berkeley DB library
   	and header searches. All these cases should now work.

   		./configure
   		./configure --with-db
   		./configure --with-db=/usr/local/BerkeleyDB-4.2
   		./configure --without-db

   !	Fixed time stamp variables to use the time_t instead of
	assuming a long.

   !	Fixed the start-up script to unalias shell function names
	before defining the function. Reported by Francisco of
	Blackant dot Net.

   !	Encapsulated announce/pass/fail output the startup-script to
	support different OS favours; some like pretty output, some
	like it simple.

   -	configure.in: Removed gcc option -fvolatile, which is no longer
   	supported in as of gcc 3.4.

   !	Renamed -x to -H.

   +	The milter now starts as a background process and can kill a
	previous instance of itself using the -x option. The -X option
	is undocumented, but starts the application as a foreground
	process for the purpose of debugging.

   +	Added support for a /etc/mail/milter-name.cf file that can
   	contain command-line options and an optional socket argument.

   !	The socket argument is now optional.

   !	The above three changes allow for a simplified startup script
	template for use by all my milters.

   +	Added -n option to avoid grey listing the null address.

   +	Added auto white listing of expected replies from a recipient
	to the initial sender. Also auto white listing of possible DSN
	messages from the recipient's domain to the initial sender.
	The latter helps in the case of call-back validation made by
	remote hosts. Based on a request by Marc Dirix.

   -	Removed the compile time option --key-fold. The database keys
   	are now always case-insensitive.

   +	Added -I option to short-circuit grey-listing only when there
	is a reverse DNS PTR record which does NOT contain any octets
	from the client's IPv4 address. In other words, skip grey
	listing if the client connection resolved and it doesn't look
	like an assignment from a dynamic IP pool. Commissioned by Chris
	Wilson. In all other cases, grey list as usual.

   +	Black list entries in access.db now cause a reject of connect,
   	MAIL, or RCPT.

  !!	Updated LICENSE.TXT.

--0.8--

   +	Requires LibSnert 1.40

   !	Renamed DataInitFromBytes() -> DataInitWithBytes() to remain
	consistent with my naming/action conventions. A *FromType is a
	copy from source and a *WithType is an assignment and/or
	passing of responsiblity of source.

--0.7--

   +	Requires LibSnert 1.39

   !	flatfile cache type should now work correctly.

   !	Fixed FreeBSD cache problem with smfSetProcessOwner() before
   	any files (specifically the cache) are opened.

   +	Added -z option to select cache type and file name, replacing
	compile time options.

   !	-r option is now disabled by default.

   !	Fixed the configuration file to recognise OpenBSD. Reported by
	Francisco of Blackant dot Net.

   !	Fixed the start-up script to unalias shell function names
	before defining the function. Reported by Francisco of
	Blackant dot Net.

   !	Added compile time option for the grey-list cache key to
	always be folded to lower-case, effectively making lookups
	case- insensitive. Request by Chris M Miller. The local-part
	of any address is actually case sensitive, but Sendmail
	doesn't care and some MTA's appear to send email to the same
	address sometimes as one case, other times as mixed case (this
	is probably a user land error from using the same account from
	multiple machines). This can result in longer than expected
	delays for the same address. The default allows for case-
	sensitive local-part.

--0.6--

   +	Requires LibSnert 1.38

   +	Bumped version to clearly indicate a new version after some
	people got hold of pre-release work in progress.

   !	Changed default cache type from BDB to Hash.

--0.5--

   +	Requires LibSnert 1.37

   +	Add VERSION.TXT to configuration for use by sendmail.shtml.

   !	Redefined -c as -C (CacheGreyListAcceptTTL) and added a new -c
	(CacheGreyListTemporaryTTL). options so that -c only applies
	to the cached `grey-list temporary' failure entries and -C
	applies to the upgraded `grey-list continue' entries. The
	intended use of of this is:

	    -b < -c <= -C

	So essentially you want to shorten the window in which a
	`grey-list temporary' entry could be upgraded to a `grey-list
	continue' entry, but allow an upgraded entry to have a longer
	life. This should prevent spammers from getting a second yet
	different spam attack through at some later time, because of
	stale `grey-list temporary' entries.

	Setting -c equal to -C would approximate previous behaviour
	of the old -c definition.

	Requested by Chris M. Miller.


   !	Fix makefile ownership target to assert correct state directory
   	permissions.

   +	Changed -k option from a code number to a bit value or comma
   	separated list of bit names: ip, helo, mail, rcpt.  Also added
   	helo as a possible element for the key.

   !	atExitCleanUp() now calls smdbClose() which mutex protects the
   	call to db->close(). For the access database this is not so
   	important, but it clearer code.

   +	atExitCleanUp() mutex protects the call to cache->sync() and
   	cache->close()

--0.4--

   +	Requires LibSnert 1.36 for major smdb() update to solve threading
   	issues and a possible memory corruption problem

   !	Clarify right hand side values of tags for white-listing. Suggested by
   	Derek Balling.  The use of FRIEND and HATER are rather particular to
   	the Spam: tag and should not be used else where (though they may be
   	treated as synoyms for OK and REJECT), as they may pose confusion for
   	Sendmail's tags.

   !	Increase default MilterSocketTimeout to 1800s (30m) to account for
   	a long connection with multiple messages.

   +	Add an instanceCount for independent tagging of log message separate
   	from the queue id.

   !	vSetReply() not checks for an MI_FAILURE from smfi_setreply().

   +	Set working directory to the state directory, where is can write
   	a core file in the event of crash.

   !	nullWorkSpace() now takes a `where' string to report in what hook
   	it failed.

   +	Added -k option to select type of grey-listing key to use. Idea taken
   	from milter-sender, based on comments from Kevin Brooks.

   !	Replaced hostname and hostaddr variables by $j and ${if_addr} macros.

   !	Removed requirement for ${client_name} and ${client_addr} macros. Now
   	use parameters given to filterOpen().

   !	Modified the nature of white-listing just a little to be a bit like
   	FEATURE(`delay_checks'). This means that a white listed RCPT can
   	override a black-listed MAIL or connection. And a white-listed MAIL
   	can override a black listed connection.

   	This behaviour only works 100% when FEATURE(`delay_checks') is
	used. When not used Sendmail will react to the black listings
	when it sees them. This is not a problem since this is
	probably what the postmaster wants.

   !	Replaced hostname and hostaddr variables by ${if_name} and
   	${if_addr} macros.

   -	Removed Spam: OK tag variant.

   !	Enabled by default From: and To: support.

   !	Replaced some commom code shared by all my milters. See libsnert
   	Sendmail Filter API (smf).

   !	Standardised the -v option across all my milters. Also support
   	textual bit names.

   !	Change grey-listing token separator from vertical bar (|) to comma (,)
   	because vertical bar is allowed in local-part names while comma is not.

   ! 	Modified license.

--0.3--

   !	Fix broken Spam: OK and FRIEND handling. Reported by Derek Balling.

   +	Added new access db tags:

   		milter-gris-from:
   		milter-gris-to:

--0.2--

   +	Requires LibSnert 1.34

   +	index.shtml: added missing information about `milter-gris-connect'
   	tag for use in the sendmail access database.

   !	Assorted changes related to smdbAccess* changes in LibSnert.

   +	Added -t option to set the sendmail/milter socket timeout

--0.1--

   +	Requires LibSnert 1.33.
